# Feature Specification: Drag-and-drop anywhere on calendar, with removal

**Feature Branch**: `008-add-behavior-drag`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add behavior : drag and drop allowed any where in the calender and can be removed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a scheduler, I want to drag a patient/procedure card from the backlog and drop it anywhere on the calendar grid to create a tentative schedule entry, and I want to remove a scheduled entry if it‚Äôs not needed, so that planning is fast and flexible without rigid target zones.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a visible backlog card and an empty calendar, when the user drags the card and drops it anywhere within the calendar area (including between cells and at arbitrary Y positions), then the system creates a schedule entry at the corresponding day/time with a default tentative status and the entry appears immediately on the calendar.
2. Given a previously scheduled entry on the calendar, when the user chooses to remove it (e.g., via a clear, discoverable remove action), then the entry is removed from the calendar and will no longer block time.
3. Given a backlog card dropped outside the calendar area, when the user releases the drag, then no schedule entry is created and the backlog remains unchanged.
4. Given an occupied time, when the user drops a card onto that time, then the system blocks the action, provides clear non-blocking feedback indicating a time conflict, and does not create a new entry (no overlaps allowed).
5. Given a scheduled entry that was removed, when the user refreshes or returns later, then the entry remains absent (i.e., removal is durable per system of record) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: removal persistence scope].

### Edge Cases
- Dropping near calendar header or outside the hour grid should not create entries and should provide subtle guidance (e.g., snap or block) [clarify UX copy].
- Drag payload missing or malformed should show a helpful message and create nothing.
- Very short drops (flicks) should still be recognized if pointer entered the calendar.
- Zoomed or high-DPI displays should still place entries at the intended time.
- Multi-day view: dropping near column edges should map to the correct day reliably.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to initiate a drag from a backlog item and drop it anywhere within the visual calendar area to create a schedule entry at the inferred day/time.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST visually confirm placement immediately by rendering the new entry at the dropped position without requiring page reload.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST snap placement to a defined time granularity (e.g., 15-minute increments) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm snap interval].
- **FR-004**: The system MUST prevent unintended creation when dropping outside the calendar; no entry should be created in that case.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a clear remove action for existing calendar entries that, when invoked, removes the entry from the calendar.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST request user confirmation for removal if required by policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm if confirmation is needed and for which roles].
- **FR-007**: The system MUST reflect removal immediately in the UI and ensure it no longer blocks or overlaps time for scheduling.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST disallow overlapping entries; dropping into an occupied time MUST be blocked with clear, non-blocking feedback and no entry created.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST support keyboard focus and accessible announcement for success/failure of drop and removal actions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accessibility requirements].
- **FR-010**: The system SHOULD display subtle guidance (e.g., ghost preview and time badge) during drag to indicate where the entry will land.
- **FR-011**: The system SHOULD allow removal only for authorized roles if role-based restrictions apply [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: roles permitted to remove].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Backlog Item**: Represents a patient/procedure awaiting scheduling; includes identity, procedure type, and estimated duration.
- **Schedule Entry**: Represents a tentative or confirmed booking on the calendar; includes start time, duration, status (tentative/confirmed), and a reference to the corresponding backlog item.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

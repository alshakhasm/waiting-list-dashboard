# Feature Specification: Main Dashboard Columns by Procedure Groups

**Feature Branch**: `003-main-dashboard-columns`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Main dashboard columns organized by procedure groups: Dental extraction, Minor pathology, Major pathology, Orthognathic, etc. Implement spec and UI structure for grouping and display."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As an OR scheduler, I want the main dashboard to display waiting list patients grouped into procedure columns (e.g., Dental extraction, Minor pathology, Major pathology, Orthognathic) so that I can quickly triage and pull candidates by category.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a backlog containing patients tagged with procedure groups, When I open the main dashboard, Then I see separate columns for each configured group with patients displayed in the appropriate column.
2. Given patients without an assigned group, When I view the dashboard, Then they appear under an "Uncategorized" column.
3. Given a name/procedure search query, When I type into the search box, Then only matching patients remain visible within their current columns and per-column counts update.
4. Given I toggle theme (Default, Warm, High-Contrast, Dark), When I switch themes, Then column headers and cards adapt to the selected theme with clear contrast and legibility.
5. Given I open the Category Sidebar, When I hide one or more categories, Then those categories disappear from the dashboard and remain hidden after reload.
6. Given I open the Category Sidebar, When I choose a color from the preset palette or set an icon for a category, Then the dashboard updates the categoryâ€™s visual accent accordingly and persists the choice between sessions.
7. Given I open the Category Sidebar, When I add a custom category (name and optional icon/color), Then a new column appears for that category and remains available on future visits until removed.

### Edge Cases
- If a configured group has no patients, the column still appears with a zero count (toggle to hide empty columns [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]).
- If many groups are configured, columns should horizontally scroll and preserve order.
- Duplicates from imports must be deduplicated before display (covered by import feature; dashboard consumes deduped backlog).

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST support a configurable set of procedure group columns on the main dashboard. Initial default set: Dental extraction, Minor pathology, Major pathology, Orthognathic, Uncategorized.
- FR-002: System MUST map each backlog item to a single procedure group using existing attributes (e.g., `caseTypeId` or `procedure` text mapping).
- FR-003: System MUST display each group as a column with a header, count badge, and a vertically ordered list of patient cards.
- FR-004: System MUST support a global search box (name and/or procedure) that filters visible items across all columns.
- FR-005: System MUST provide a Category Sidebar to manage categories, including: hide/show toggles per category, choosing a color from a small preset palette, and setting an optional icon per category.
- FR-006: System MUST support creating and removing custom categories from the Category Sidebar.
- FR-007: System MUST persist category preferences (hidden/visible state, color choice, icon, custom categories) between sessions.
- FR-008: System SHOULD allow hiding empty columns via a toggle. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-009: System SHOULD allow re-ordering columns and saving the order. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Key Entities
- ProcedureGroup (concept): name, displayLabel, colorKey, order, optional icon.
- CategoryPreference: categoryId/name, hidden (bool), color (preset key or hex), icon (string/emoji), custom (bool).
- BacklogItem (existing): patientName, maskedMrn, procedure, estDurationMin, caseTypeId, surgeonId? (no change in display requirement for surgeon on dashboard columns).

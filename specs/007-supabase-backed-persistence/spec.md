# Feature Specification: Supabase-backed Persistence and Roles

**Feature Branch**: `007-supabase-backed-persistence`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Supabase-backed persistence and roles: staff add-only, seniors edit. UI uses Supabase when env present; fallback to in-process adapter for local dev."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a team using the OR dashboard, we want our data to persist and access to be role-based so that staff can add (create) items but not modify existing ones, and seniors can edit (update/delete) entries. The UI should automatically use the cloud database when configured and otherwise work locally for development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given valid Supabase credentials are configured, When a staff user creates a schedule entry, Then the entry is saved in the cloud and visible to all users.
2. Given valid Supabase credentials are configured, When a staff user attempts to update or delete any schedule entry, Then the action is rejected.
3. Given valid Supabase credentials are configured, When a senior user updates or deletes a schedule entry, Then the change is saved and visible to all users.
4. Given no Supabase credentials are configured, When a user uses the app, Then the app runs with local in-memory behavior identical to before (non-persistent).
5. Given a user is unauthenticated, When they try to access protected operations, Then they are prevented and informed they need to sign in.

### Edge Cases
- Intermittent connectivity: operations should fail gracefully; user is informed without corrupting state.
- Conflicting edits: seniors receive clear conflict feedback (optimistic concurrency remains in effect where applicable).
- Role changes mid-session: after refresh, new role takes effect for authorization decisions.
- Rate limits/quotas on the free tier: the system provides a clear error and suggests retry later.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST persist backlog and schedule to a hosted data store when cloud configuration is present.
- FR-002: System MUST allow ‚Äústaff‚Äù role to create (add) schedule entries but NOT update or delete them.
- FR-003: System MUST allow ‚Äúsenior‚Äù role to create, update, and delete schedule entries.
- FR-004: System MUST allow all authenticated users to read backlog and schedule.
- FR-005: System MUST provide a local fallback mode without credentials that uses in-memory data for development/demo.
- FR-006: The UI MUST adapt based on role (hide/disable edit controls for staff; expose for seniors) while server-side authorization still enforces rules.
- FR-007: System MUST present clear error messages when an operation is denied due to role restrictions.
- FR-008: Sign-in/out MUST be available to obtain a user identity and role for authorization.
- FR-009: System MUST not require any backend server management by the user (managed service only).

### Key Entities
- User: identity with a role attribute (staff | senior) used for authorization decisions.
- Backlog Item: patientName, maskedMrn, procedure, estDurationMin, surgeonId?, caseTypeId.
- Schedule Entry: waitingListItemId, date, startTime, endTime, roomId, surgeonId, status (tentative | confirmed), notes.

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

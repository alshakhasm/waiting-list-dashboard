# Research: UI Aesthetics

## Decisions & Rationale
- Two themes: Default and High-Contrast for accessibility and focus
- Editor-inspired palette favors legibility and muted backgrounds
- Non-color indicators reduce reliance on color alone

## Open Questions
- Exact font family stack to adopt (availability/licensing)
- Minimum contrast ratios per component type (beyond base standard)
- How preferences are scoped (per user vs per device)

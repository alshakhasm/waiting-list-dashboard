# Feature Specification: UI Aesthetics (Coding Environment-inspired)

**Feature Branch**: `002-ui-esthetics-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UI esthetics like coding software enviroments . colors and fonts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a coordinator using the OR dashboard daily, I want the UI to feel like modern coding environments (clean typography, subtle backgrounds, and syntax-inspired accents) so that long sessions are comfortable, legible, and focused.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the dashboard is loaded in Default theme, When I scan lists and calendar, Then typography is consistent, spacing is comfortable, and color accents improve scannability without distracting from content.
2. Given I switch theme between Default, Warm, High-Contrast, Dark, or Auto, When viewing cards and calendar entries, Then colors and indicators maintain readability and contrast, respecting system preferences in Auto.
3. Given I return to the app later, When the UI loads, Then my last selected theme is applied automatically (persisted between sessions).
4. Given I scroll the app, When the header is visible, Then the top header remains sticky with a light tint and shadow that adapts to the theme.

### Edge Cases
- Very long names/procedures: truncation with tooltip works without layout shift.
- Small screens: primary actions remain accessible; content does not overlap.
- High-contrast mode enabled: all semantic colors adapt and remain distinguishable without relying solely on color.
- System font fallback: if the preferred font fails to load, the fallback stack remains readable and stable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST provide multiple visual themes: Default, Warm, High-Contrast, Dark, and Auto (follow system).
- FR-002: System MUST use a professional UI font stack appropriate for dense data views, with a readable proportional alternative for body text.
- FR-003: Users SHOULD be able to select font size presets (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) that scale typography and spacing consistently. [Deferred]
- FR-004: System MUST provide a consistent color palette inspired by coding editors (muted backgrounds, syntax-like accents) applied to cards, calendar blocks, and statuses.
- FR-005: System MUST ensure color contrast ratios meet the team‚Äôs accessibility standard for normal and high-contrast modes.
- FR-006: System MUST provide non-color indicators (icons, patterns, or shapes) for key statuses to avoid color-only signaling.
- FR-007: System MUST keep typography and spacing scale consistent across lists, calendar, dialogs, and menus.
- FR-008: System MUST degrade gracefully under font loading failures using a defined fallback stack without layout jank.
- FR-009: System MUST avoid excessive visual noise (limited shadows, borders, animations) prioritizing clarity and focus.
- FR-010: System MUST support keyboard focus-visible styles that are clearly perceivable in all themes.
- FR-011: System MUST persist the user‚Äôs selected theme (and Auto/system preference) between sessions.

### Key Entities
- Theme: name, palette (semantic tokens), contrast_mode.
- Preference: user_id, theme, updated_at.

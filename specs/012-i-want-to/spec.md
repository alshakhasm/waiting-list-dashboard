**Feature Branch**: `012-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to add a \" card roller \" tab . it work loke one card at atime . with next and previous arrows. each card show full info of patient"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: How should navigation behave at the ends of the list? ‚Üí A: Stop at ends (disable at first/last)
- Q: Do you want keyboard navigation mapping? ‚Üí A: Up = Previous, Down = Next
- Q: Should the card include quick actions? ‚Üí A: Edit, Schedule, Remove
- Q: Which ordering should Card Roller use? ‚Üí A: Chronological by created date (oldest‚Üínewest)
- Q: Should Card Roller respect filters or require category selection? ‚Üí A: Require selecting a category; show only that category
- Q: What if the selected category has zero items? ‚Üí A: Show empty state message ("No items in this category")

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a scheduler or clinician reviewing the backlog, I want a "Card Roller" view that shows one patient card at a time with full details and simple Next/Previous navigation, so I can review patients sequentially without distraction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** there are items in the backlog, **When** I open the Card Roller tab, **Then** I see the first patient‚Äôs card with complete details and navigation controls (Previous disabled on first card, Next enabled if more exist).
2. **Given** I am on a card that is not the last, **When** I press Next, **Then** the next patient‚Äôs full card appears and the position indicator updates (e.g., "3 of 12").
3. **Given** I am on the last card, **When** I press Next, **Then** Next is disabled and no further navigation occurs (no looping).
4. **Given** I am on any card, **When** I press Previous, **Then** I see the prior patient‚Äôs card or the control is disabled on the first card.
5. **Given** I resize the window or switch themes, **When** I view the card, **Then** content remains readable and the layout adapts without overlapping content.
6. **Given** there are zero backlog items, **When** I open the Card Roller tab, **Then** I see an empty state message with guidance.
7. **Given** I‚Äôm using the keyboard, **When** I press Up/Down arrows, **Then** it navigates Previous (Up) and Next (Down).
8. **Given** I‚Äôm reviewing a card, **When** I click a quick action (Edit, Schedule, or Remove), **Then** the action completes and the navigation position is preserved; if the item is removed, the view advances to the next item (or previous if no next; or shows empty state if list becomes empty).
9. **Given** I open Card Roller without a category selected, **When** the view loads, **Then** I am prompted to select a category; after selection, the first card of that category is shown.
10. **Given** I switch the selected category, **When** I confirm the new category, **Then** the Card Roller resets to the first item of the newly selected category (chronological order), or shows empty state if none.
11. **Given** the selected category has zero items, **When** I view Card Roller, **Then** I see an empty state that reads "No items in this category" with an affordance to change category.

### Edge Cases
- Large text or long notes: the card should scroll internally or expand without breaking layout.
- Missing fields (e.g., no phone2): show clearly as empty/placeholder instead of blank UI.
- Concurrent changes: if the underlying backlog updates, the card should refresh or show a subtle notice [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: live updates vs. static snapshot].
- Access/permissions: users without edit rights should see read-only cards [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which roles can edit?].
- Filters/search: when a search/filter is applied elsewhere, Card Roller should respect the same item set and order [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: source and ordering rules].

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a new top-level tab or entry named "Card Roller" accessible from the UI navigation.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display exactly one backlog patient card at a time in this view.
- **FR-003**: System MUST include Previous and Next controls to move between cards in sequence.
- **FR-004**: System MUST show the current position indicator (e.g., "1 of N").
- **FR-005**: System MUST render full patient information on the card including: patient name, MRN, procedure, estimated minutes, case type/priority, category, surgeon (if any), phones, preferred date, created date, and notes. If a field is missing, show a clear placeholder (e.g., "‚Äî").
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty datasets by showing an informative empty state.
- **FR-007**: System MUST stop at the ends: disable Previous on the first card and disable Next on the last card (no looping).
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide keyboard navigation with Up = Previous and Down = Next.
- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the current position stable after performing in-card actions (Edit, Schedule) and, when removing the current item, advance to the next item; if no next exists, move to the previous; if the list becomes empty, show the empty state.
- **FR-013**: System MUST expose quick actions on the card: Edit, Schedule, and Remove (visible only to users with permission).
- **FR-010**: System MUST step through items in chronological created date order (oldest ‚Üí newest), independent of other views‚Äô sort.
- **FR-011**: System MUST adapt for both light and dark themes with accessible contrast for all text.
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure that users without permissions see a read-only card state and cannot trigger restricted actions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact permissions].
- **FR-014**: System MUST require selecting a category before showing cards; only items from the selected category are included. Changing the category resets position to the first item of that category.
- **FR-015**: System MUST show an empty state with the copy "No items in this category" when the selected category contains zero items and provide an affordance to change category.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Card (Backlog Item View)**: Represents a single backlog item‚Äôs full details as shown in the Card Roller; includes field formatting and action affordances.
- **Navigation Context**: The ordered collection of backlog item IDs the Card Roller iterates through, derived from active filters and sort.

# Feature Specification: Compact scheduling calendar without hours

**Feature Branch**: `009-calender-for-schedulign`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "calender for schedulign doesn need hours and should be compact"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a scheduler, I want a compact calendar view that does not display hourly rows so I can see more days and entries at a glance, prioritize by order and capacity, and move items quickly without the clutter of time slots.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the scheduler opens the app, when the calendar loads, then the compact calendar is the default view and renders without explicit hour lines or time-of-day labels while still showing entries grouped by day.
2. Given the compact calendar is visible, when the user drags a backlog card into a day, then the entry is added to that day in the compact view without requiring a specific time selection (no time needed).
3. Given entries exist for a day, when the number exceeds the visible area, then the calendar indicates overflow (e.g., a "+N more" indicator) or allows scrolling within the day block. The chosen approach SHOULD preserve quick scan and performance.
4. Given the compact calendar is visible, when the user switches between Day, Week, and Month, then the entries are displayed for the appropriate range with no time-of-day rows, and state (e.g., selected day) persists across switches.
5. Given role-based policies, when a user lacks edit permissions, then the compact view still hides hours but disables drag/add operations while allowing read visibility.
6. Given the calendar is visible, when the user clicks the full-screen icon in the top bar, then the calendar expands to full-screen and the icon updates to allow exit; clicking again exits full-screen and restores the previous layout.

### Edge Cases
- Days with no entries should render as minimal-height cells without hour markers.
- Very high entry counts on a single day should remain performant and usable (overflow handling applies).
- Switching views rapidly should not duplicate or lose entries.
- Entries are displayed in a stable order; default ordering is sequential by creation/drop order within the day.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a compact calendar view that omits hour rows and time-of-day labels.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display scheduled entries grouped under each day in compact view.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow adding entries to a day without specifying an exact time when using the compact view (time-less entries are valid in compact view).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support optional duration for entries; entries without duration default to a standard equal visual size within the day. No time-based view is provided.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST support reordering or prioritizing entries within a day via drag-and-drop; default ordering is sequential by drop/creation order.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST treat duration as optional in compact view; when duration is unspecified, entries within a day render with equal visual size.
- **FR-007**: The system SHOULD display duration (if provided) in a compact way without introducing hour slots.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle overflow for days with many entries through an indicator or internal scrolling.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST respect permissions; users without edit rights cannot add or reorder entries in compact view.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD optimize for quick scanning and minimal vertical space across Day, Week, and Month compact views.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST support switching between Day, Week, and Month compact views without losing context or data.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST display entries for the selected range (day/week/month) without hour slots; duration remains optional and, if absent, entries render at equal size.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide a full-screen toggle control in the top bar for the calendar; activating it MUST expand the calendar to occupy the full viewport and provide a clear means to exit full-screen.
- **FR-013**: The system SHOULD optionally remember full-screen state during the current session only and MUST NOT persist this state across app restarts.
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD provide simple, at-a-glance counts per day (e.g., total entries, total duration if known) without exposing hour slots explicitly.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Compact Calendar Day**: Container for entries on a given date in compact mode; no hour granularity.
- **Schedule Entry**: Existing entity; in compact view, renders without time-of-day details but remains linked to its underlying data.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

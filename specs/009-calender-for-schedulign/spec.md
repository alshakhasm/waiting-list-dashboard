# Feature Specification: Compact scheduling calendar without hours

**Feature Branch**: `009-calender-for-schedulign`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "calender for schedulign doesn need hours and should be compact"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a scheduler, I want a compact calendar view that does not display hourly rows so I can see more days and entries at a glance, prioritize by order and capacity, and move items quickly without the clutter of time slots.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the scheduler opens the app, when the calendar loads, then the compact calendar renders without hour lines or time-of-day labels while still showing entries grouped by day.
2. Given the compact calendar is visible, when the user drags a backlog card into a day, then the system assigns a sequential time window after the last entry of that day (for internal ordering only), and the entry is added without requiring an explicit time selection.
3. Given entries exist for a day, when the number exceeds the visible area, then the calendar allows scrolling within the day block. The layout preserves quick scan and performance.
4. Given the compact calendar is visible, when the user switches between Day, Week, and Month, then the entries are displayed for the appropriate range with no time-of-day rows.
5. Given permissions, when a user lacks edit rights, then drag/add operations are disabled while read visibility remains.
6. Given a scheduled entry card, when the user checks the ‚ÄúConfirmed‚Äù checkbox on the card, then the entry status toggles between tentative and confirmed and persists.
7. Given the calendar is visible, when the user clicks the full-screen icon in the top bar, then the calendar expands to full-screen and the icon updates to allow exit; clicking again exits full-screen and restores the previous layout.

### Edge Cases
- Days with no entries should render as minimal-height cells without hour markers.
- Very high entry counts on a single day should remain performant and usable (overflow handling applies).
- Switching views rapidly should not duplicate or lose entries.
- Entries are displayed in a stable order; default ordering is sequential by creation/drop order within the day.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST provide a compact calendar view that omits hour rows and time-of-day labels.
- FR-002: The system MUST display scheduled entries grouped under each day in compact view.
- FR-003: The system MUST allow adding entries to a day without specifying an exact time; the system MAY auto-assign internal sequential times for ordering.
- FR-004: The system MUST support optional duration for entries; entries without duration default to a standard equal visual size within the day.
- FR-005: The system SHOULD enable reordering/prioritizing entries within a day; default ordering is sequential by drop/creation or auto-assigned time.
- FR-006: The system SHOULD display duration (if provided) compactly without introducing hour slots.
- FR-007: The system MUST handle overflow for days with many entries via internal scrolling in the day cell.
- FR-008: The system MUST respect permissions; users without edit rights cannot add or reorder entries in compact view.
- FR-009: The system SHOULD optimize for quick scanning and minimal vertical space across Day, Week, and Month compact views.
- FR-010: The system MUST support switching between Day, Week, and Month compact views without losing context or data.
- FR-011: The system MUST provide a full-screen toggle control; activating it expands the calendar to occupy the full viewport and provides a clear means to exit full-screen.
- FR-012: The system SHOULD provide simple at-a-glance counts per day (e.g., total entries) without exposing hour slots.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Compact Calendar Day**: Container for entries on a given date in compact mode; no hour granularity.
- **Schedule Entry**: Existing entity; in compact view, renders without time-of-day details but remains linked to its underlying data.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
